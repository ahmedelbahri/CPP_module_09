## About

This module explores various advanced concepts in C++ that build on the knowledge acquired in previous modules. Key topics include:

- **Containers and Iterators**: Understanding and working with more complex data structures like sets, maps, and lists.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Exploring algorithms related to searching, sorting, and manipulating collections of data.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Delving into design patterns and best practices to structure and organize code efficiently.
- **Exception Safety**: Ensuring that programs are robust and can recover from unexpected errors.

## Topics Covered

### **Containers and Iterators**
- **STL Containers**: Set, map, list, and others.
- **Custom Iterators**: How to create and use custom iterators for your containers.
- **Algorithm Usage**: Leveraging STL algorithms with containers.

### **Advanced Algorithms**
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Exploring binary search, depth-first search (DFS), and breadth-first search (BFS).
- **Graph Algorithms**: Introduction to graph traversal algorithms and shortest path algorithms.

### **Object-Oriented Design**
- **Design Patterns**: Implementing common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer.
- **SOLID Principles**: Applying principles of object-oriented design to improve software architecture and maintainability.

### **Exception Safety**
- **Exception Handling**: Advanced techniques for handling exceptions in a way that ensures program stability.
- **Exception Guarantees**: Understanding basic, strong, and no-throw guarantees in code.
- **Smart Pointers**: Deep dive into the use of `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`.
